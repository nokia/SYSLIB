# SYSLIB SOC Initialization Configuration
#
#  This is a sample configuration file which is provided by SYSLIB for
#  K2K. The function allows the SYSLIB SOC Initialization application to
#  cycle through and initialize all the CPDMA blocks with the specified
#  configuration.
#
#  Please ensure that the CPDMA identifiers match the DMA identifiers
#  specified in the cppi_drv.h. Failure to do so can result in fatal
#  errors.
#
#  By default all the CPDMA blocks are not powered on which implies that the
#  CPDMA configuration cannot be done. For such CPDMA blocks please ensure
#  that the 'power_up' flag is set.
